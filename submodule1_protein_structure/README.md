# Submodule 1: Protein Structure

## Overview

This module serves as an introductory module for drug design, and any undergraduate student can use this module to learn the protein structure. The module starts with the learning of basic protein structure in detail from primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures with examples and also provides the physicochemical basis of principles of protein 3D structure. Each part involves examples and tutorials using visualization software. To test the userâ€™s knowledge, assignments are provided, and users can utilize the tutorial they go through to solve the assignment problem. Public online software for protein sequence analysis such as Uniprot, a protein data bank is used for analysis. Visualization can be done by Chimera or Pymol software. 3D visualization also involves binding site analysis of different protein-drug interactions and comparison of binding sites of different proteins. For proteins that do not have any 3D structures, experimental data such as secondary structure data is used to analyze the structure and a prediction is performed using homology modeling using ColabAlpha Fold.

## Learning Objectives

1. To visualize the 3D structure of proteins and describe the details of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.
2. To compare protein sequences and explain the similarity in protein sequences. To model the 3D structure of proteins based on homology modeling. To analyze the quality of protein structure generated from modeling tools
3. To analyze the interface of protein-protein interactions by visualization of protein surfaces between the two interacting proteins. Find the secondary structure elements responsible for holding the ligand and the receptor proteins. Analyze the protein surfaces for charge and hydrophobicity using 3D structure tools.
4. Using web-based tools, identify the hot spots in protein surfaces suitable for binding to hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or lipophilic molecules.

## Key Tools and Datasets
